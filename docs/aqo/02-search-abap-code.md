### ZAQO_EDITOR_OLD
{: .no_toc }

№ 1 - There is a button in the DEV system that shows where an option was created from. \
In all other systems the button is hidden

№ 2 - You can also use RunTime code scanning (in case the code creation block has been moved to another place) \
To do this, use the lower search help tool (in **Option ID** field)\
In success the search help marks found rows with **'X'**
