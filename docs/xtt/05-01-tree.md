If you have ordinary table with simple totals you should use abap internal tables.<br/>
But if you also have to display subtotals and other hierarchical structures it's better to use `trees`.<br/>
There are 2 methods to create trees. In this page I'll try to explain the first one `TREE_CREATE`.<br/>
About the `TREE_CREATE_RELAT` you can read in the [follwing page](../tree-group-by-field-relations/).

### TREE_CREATE method
{: .no_toc }

```abap
    " Document structure
    BEGIN OF ts_root,
      title TYPE string,
      t     TYPE  REF TO data, " better to use general type than zcl_xtt_replace_block=>ts_tree
    END OF ts_root.

    ls_root-t = zcl_xtt_replace_block=>tree_create(
     it_table      = lr_table       " from 7.5 REF #(lt_rows)
     iv_fields     = 'GROUP'   ).   " Name of the fields delimited by ;
```
The simplest way to describe the method is to imagine ALV grid with different subtotals.
```abap
 iv_fields     = 'BUKRS'        " Subtotals by 1 field
 iv_fields     = 'BUKRS;WERKS'  " Subtotals bt 2 fields
```

to calculate sums (and averages, for example) you should define handler to process tree and subitems
```abap
      on_prepare_tree_05 FOR EVENT prepare_tree OF zcl_xtt_replace_block
        IMPORTING
            ir_tree      " Type Ref To ZCL_XTT_REPLACE_BLOCK=>TS_TREE
            ir_data      " Type Ref To DATA
            ir_sub_data, " Type Ref To DATA
```
first of all in the handler you have to cast data to original data types
```abap
  FIELD-SYMBOLS:
    <ls_data>     TYPE ts_tree_05,
    <ls_sub_data> TYPE ts_tree_05.

  " Cast to specific data
  ASSIGN:
   ir_data->*        TO <ls_data>,
   ir_sub_data->*    TO <lt_sub_data>.
```
and in the loop you can calculate whatever you need
```abap
  " And calc sums
  LOOP AT <lt_sub_data> ASSIGNING <ls_sub_data>.
    <ls_data>-sum1  = <ls_data>-sum1 + <ls_sub_data>-sum1.
    <ls_data>-sum2  = <ls_data>-sum2 + <ls_sub_data>-sum2.
  ENDLOOP.
```

***
In the template if you have different rows formatting for each level you can specify them by `;level=` and `;top=` additions.
If subitems go after parental item just add `;top=X` for the level, otherwise `;top=` or just omit it.

Also if you specify outline level in the template it will be replicated in the final report for the corresponding items.

The result look like in ALV GRID
