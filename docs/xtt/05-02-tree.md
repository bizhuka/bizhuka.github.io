What if [in the previous example](../tree-group-by-fields/) at the level **{R-T;level=1}** it would not be enough to divide the tree by:
* **{R-T;level=1;top=X}** upper &
* **{R-T;level=1;top=}** bottom<br/>
blocks ?

Sometimes it is necessary to show special HEADER for a certain BUKRS. In Excel, you can use [conditional formatting.](Https://spreadsheeto.com/conditional-formatting/)<br/>
But what if you need to merge several cells in the header or hide the header completely or do it in Word or Pdf?

### ABAP approach
Previously, this could be achieved using the special method ZCL_XTT_REPLACE_BLOCK=<br/>>ON_TREE_CHANGE_LEVEL
in which it was possible to replace level 1 with another one.

You could just create levels 55, 66 or 77 in the template (Any fairly large level that will certainly not be displayed)

and in the event handler change **IV_LEVEL_INDEX->*** with desired level. If you assign a value that is not in the pattern (-1), then the level would simply disappear.

But this approach has a significant drawback. In order to understand how the final template will look like, you need to go to the ABAP code editor and see these conditions.

### Declarative approach
For the readability of the template 2 additions:
* **show_if** &
* **hide_if**<br/>
was introduced.

They work like the **CASE** statement.<br/>
If all conditions are false, the default block **WHEN OTHERS** will work for the given level. Which could be omitted and would not be displayed in the final report (But explicitly stated **hide_if** is preferable)<br/>
In the example below, line 6 works like _WHEN OTHERS_

To indicate the current level the **row** keyword has been introduced(Case insensitive, like any ABAP code). You can write any ABAP condition. For example, except for mathematical conditions like =, <>,> =, <= their analogues EQ, NE, GT, LT can be used. (CP, NP, CO, CN, CA, NA, CS, NS are also acceptable)

As a result, each level **{R-T;level=1}** has its own title:
* **C** - Yellow
* **B** - Consisting of 2 vertically merged cells
* **A** - Default
* **D** - Hidden

### Combining level, top, show_if, hide_if
Any combination is permissible. Conditions can be set or omitted at any level.<br/>
<br/>
If you use only **level** (without top, show_if, hide_if) the subtotals will be displayed below each level (top=abap_false and no conditions for output).<br/>
<br/>
**show_if** and **hide_if** additions can be used without any **level** or **top**. You can call zcl_xtt_replace_block=>tree_create(iv_fields = ''). The table is converted to a tree with levels=0, and for each level you can set your conditional output
